# Nextorm - high performance zero-sql object-relational mapping (ORM) library

## Overview

Nextorm perform two main functions:
- Generate SQL code
- Map relational data into language (or rather a framework) structures such as classes, primitive types, arrays, lists, etc.

Nextorm uses protocol-level libraries (for example, SqlClient for Microsoft SQL Server or SQLite for SQLite) and designed to create a high performance data access layer independent of SQL and specific RDBMS.
